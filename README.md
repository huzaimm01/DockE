# DockE – An Emoji Dock for Desktop 

Do you often transition from mobile to desktop texting?  
I do, too. I always found it annoying to use certain emojis on platforms like **Instagram Desktop**.

### The Problem
Ever typed out a joke, only to think,  
"I need to add an emoji to make this work better:  
...only to realize you'd have to:

- Open a new tab  
- Google "tired emoji"  
- Copy it  
- Paste it back into chat  

By then?  
**The conversation's moved on. The joke's dead. The moment’s gone.**

### The Solution: DockE  
One bored Sunday afternoon, I built **DockE** — a desktop emoji dock that gives you **instant access to your favorite emojis**.

✅ **Customizable Emoji Panel**  
✅ **One-click copy to clipboard**  
✅ **Saves time and saves the joke**  
✅ **Desktop-first** — built for the platforms that forgot emojis matter

### Why Use DockE?  
Your jokes deserve proper timing and formatting.  
No one should Google “Crying emoji” just to have multiple options and have to dig through for the right one.  
Sometimes? It’s the little touches that make conversations fun.

**Built with love, frustration, and a little bit of wishing I'd done anything else with my weekend**
